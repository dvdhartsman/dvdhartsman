- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

**Data Scientist|Analyst** 

*Graduate of the Flatiron School Data Science program with professional experience as a performing musician, educator, and professional poker player.* 

I have a passion for extracting meaningful insights from data. I enjoy taking those insights and developing actionable items to help improve organizational outcomes. I am actively learning new skills, working on projects large and small, studying online with DataCamp and other resources, and expanding my toolkit. 


- **Projects**: *Large-Scale Projects*

  -- [Computer Vision - Bird Species Classification](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/Bird_Species_Image_Classification)
    - *Using Keras/Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Networks to develop a model capable of identifying 525 different bird species*
    - *Deployment of the final model using Streamlit (link to app found below)*

  -- [Stock Market Analysis](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/Stock_Market_Analysis)
    - *Analysis and model creation of stock market data consolidated from multiple sources for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, Russell 2000, and Dow Jones Industrial Average*
    - *Multiple iterations of classification models predicting positive returns over 1, 3, 6, and 12 month time horizons using Scitkit-Learn*
    - *Time series regression models created using univariate ARIMA and LSTM models* 
  
  -- [Natural Language Processing Analysis](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/NLP-Sentiment-Analysis)
    - *Analysis and vectorization of tweets from the 2013 South by Southwest Conference*
    - *Tokenized, lemmatized, and vectorized the tweets using the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) library and Scitkit-Learn*
    - *Created two separate One-vs-Rest models to identify positive and negative sentiment, and a multiclass model to assess overall sentiment*
  
  -- [Tanzanian Water Well Operating Status Predictions](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/Tanzanian_Water_Pumps)
    - *Curated and engineered features about Tanzanian Water wells to predict their operational status and if they needed repairs*
    - *Utilized Scitkit-Learn Logistic Regression models to develop a multi-class classification model
