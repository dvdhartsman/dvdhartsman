## Hello and Welcome Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is David Hartsman (He/Him)

**Data Scientist | Engineer | Analyst**

#### About Me: 

*Data Scientist @ Omdena, Graduate of the Flatiron School Data Science program, professional experience as a performing musician, educator, and professional poker player.* 

My unique background in music, education, and professional poker has shaped my ability to approach data problems creatively and strategically. I excel at leveraging data to drive positive business outcomes, bolstered by my strong communication skills and ability to work effectively with diverse teams. I am excited to use my unique skill set to tackle complex data challenges and
contribute to impactful projects.

    - *Merged multiple different datasets to create aggregated season statistics for each team* 
    - *Engineered features/interaction terms to iteratively improve model performance*

  -- [Stock Market Analysis](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/Stock_Market_Analysis)
    - *Analysis and model creation of stock market data consolidated from multiple sources for the S&P 500, Nasdaq, Russell 2000, and Dow Jones Industrial Average*
    - *Multiple iterations of classification models predicting positive returns over 1, 3, 6, and 12 month time horizons using Scitkit-Learn*
    - *Time series regression models created using univariate ARIMA and LSTM models* 
  
  -- [Natural Language Processing Analysis](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/NLP-Sentiment-Analysis)
    - *Analysis and vectorization of tweets from the 2013 South by Southwest Conference*
    - *Tokenized, lemmatized, and vectorized the tweets using the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) library and Scitkit-Learn*
    - *Created two separate One-vs-Rest models to identify positive and negative sentiment, and a multiclass model to assess overall sentiment*
  
  -- [Tanzanian Water Well Operating Status Predictions](https://github.com/dvdhartsman/Tanzanian_Water_Pumps)
    - *Curated and engineered features about Tanzanian Water wells to predict their operational status and if they needed repairs*
    - *Utilized Scitkit-Learn Logistic Regression models to develop a multi-class classification model*
